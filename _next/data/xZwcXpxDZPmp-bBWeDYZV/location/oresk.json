The capital ([Kirov](/location/kirov)) and most of its outlying towns are within [Udasil's](/realm/udasil) [nexus](/realm/nexus); this has hardened the Oreskians, forcing them to become stronger and more innovative to survive. Food decays hours after harvest, small injuries can quickly spiral into life-threatening complications, and the cold in the region seems to sap strength away from all who are exposed for too long.\n\nAs such, the people of Oresk have adapted: many of the world's greatest inventors have come from Oresk, and their medical facilities are said to be of the highest quality available. Magic lamps that imbue those in their area with warmth dot the countryside and fill the streets, small garden cloches that can sustainably -- and locally -- grow food are commonplace in restaurants, and magic-imbued wafers can offer the same benefits of potions without instantly freezing when exposed to air.\n\nTo maintain order in a harsh environment that would otherwise promote an every-man-for-himself atmosphere, Oresk's political structure is that of a stratocracy -- meaning complete military rule. Civic duties are performed by specific posts in the army, and policy decisions are made by a council of its generals. While a mandatory draft during adolescence ensures that all Oreskians serve two years in government, many see their duty as an honor and will stay once their time is complete.\n\n"}],"kind":"Location","name":"Oresk","path":["Location","Oresk"],"id":"Location/Oresk","linked":[{"name":"Anatoli
