Different civilizations across the [Astra](/natural-phenomena/astra) call Manifestation different names — magic, worldshaping, spellcasting, psionics, words of power, martial arts, grave-singing, mind over matter, allomancy, temperwright, and hundreds of others.\n\nWhile Manifestation may have completely different appearances and observable effects in different localities, the base process remains the same: ambient energy is pulled from some source within the [locality](/natural-phenomena/locality) and is manipulated to cause an effect. Common examples include incantations to Manifest flame within a short distance and metal piercings that grant improved sight to their wearer.\n\nColloquially, this is known as magic -- but Manifestation also powers a monk's ki, a champion's divine smite, and an alchemist's reagents. The greatest sources of energy in the [Crystal Sphere](/natural-phenomena/crystal-sphere) are the twelve [realms](/realm/realms) that orbit [Althane](/realm/althane) (but the Deep in the core of the planet powers some of the more taboo spells).\n\nSpellcasting is the most prevalent example of Manifestation in Althane. It's believed to be one of the more potent forms, but its use permanently alters the user. An easily-spotted effect is the rings of color that form in the sclera of the eyes of a spellcaster (called spellrings). The color of the rings is derived from the realm that a caster channels; while the quantity and thickness are from the potency of the spells cast.\n\nThe energy used to manifest something is called mana.\n\n"}],"kind":"Natural Phenomena","name":"Manifestation","path":["Natural Phenomena","Manifestation"],"id":"Natural Phenomena/Manifestation","linked":[{"name":"Aetheric Laws","kind":"Natural
