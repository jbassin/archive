Manifestation is the art of drawing arcane energy from some source, channeling it through the body, and creating some effect. Colloquially, this is known as magic -- but Manifestation also powers a monk's ki, a champion's divine smite, and an alchemist's reagents. The greatest sources of energy in the Sphere are the twelve realms that orbit Althane (but theÂ Deep in the core of the planet powers some of the more taboo spells).

Spellcasting is a prevalent example of Manifestation. It's believed to be the most potent form, but its use permanently alters the user. An easily-spotted effect is the rings of color that form in the sclera of the eyes of a spellcaster. The color of the rings is derived from the realm that a caster channels; while the quantity and thickness are from the potency of the spells cast.

The energy used to manifest something is called mana.
