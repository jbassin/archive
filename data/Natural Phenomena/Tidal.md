The Tidal is a miles-high wave that begins on the easternmost part of the continent and travels across the entire ocean until it slams into the westernmost coast — which happens to be Salores.

While the Tidal doesn’t come on regular intervals, it’s arrival can be predicted in advance by careful observation of the location of the realms as well as tectonic activities. This job is usually done by the Wavereaders of Vallastela — an occupation that is held in very high esteem (at least, when they get it right).

The Tidal is preceded by a harsh storm front before it slams into the coast, with floodwaters traveling miles inland before finally receding back into the ocean. The severity of the wave, combined with the twice-monthly frequency of the event, makes sailing on the western coast a dangerous proposition and rules out most forms of agriculture.
