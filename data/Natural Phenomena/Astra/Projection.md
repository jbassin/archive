Roughly speaking, the world consists of three overlayed strata. The base layer is the Aetheric field -- a heterogeneous distribution of energy everywhere across the Astra. Laid atop that is the Weave, an interface layer that provides an energy sink for the aether. Finally, the third layer is the Enneract, the space-time-spirit continuum upon which the entire world is built.
