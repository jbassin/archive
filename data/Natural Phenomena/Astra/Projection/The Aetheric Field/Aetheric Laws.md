As the energy within the Aether is non-uniformly distributed, it can be extrapolated that there are laws that govern the energy's behavior. The three primary laws are the law of mass, the law of impulse, and the law of consumption.

### The Law of Mass

Mana flows from points of low mass to high mass. Mass, in this instance, does not refer only to matter. Matter is only one of three distinct kinds of mass: matter is somatic mass, information is noetic mass, and zaman is chronetic mass. Furthermore, the more concentrated the mass is, the stronger the pull exerted on the mana in the surrounding area.

### The Law of Impulse

Mana tends towards objects with high continuous momentum. Quickly moving objects and very large slow-moving objects both have high impulse, and as such tend to attract mana. This is most commonly seen around celestial bodies, such as planets, whose orbits gather large quantities of arcane energy.

### The Law of Consumption

Mana pulled from the Aetheric field through the weave is "consumed" and its polarity is reversed. Consumed mana is repelled by unconsumed mana, and as such tends away from higher concentrations of the Aether. This process is what drives the expansion of the Astra -- mana is consumed by magic processes and is then repelled to areas of lower and lower aetheric density until it reaches the edge of the rim. Consumed mana, if not interacted with for a long enough period, will eventually revert to its base state.
