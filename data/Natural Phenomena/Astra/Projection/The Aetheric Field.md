The Aetheric field is a non-uniform distribution of energy spread across the entire Astra. It's the sole source of arcane energy across the Astra (although most tap into the field through the Weave as an intermediary). While the Aether cannot be physically touched, it can be indirectly manipulated -- namely through the aetheric laws.
