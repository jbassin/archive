### §2.6 On the Subject of the Nine Dimensions, and Their Inherent Qualities, and the Relationships Therein

The Astra can be most correctly mapped on a nine-dimensional <span class="italic">n</span>-cube, commonly called an Enneract. Unfortunately, most beings lack the faculties to properly visualize <span class="italic">n</span>-cubes of higher dimensions. To combat this, the standard@footnote([1], as per Hyannes et. al.) representation is three separate trigrams of three axes each.

The first trigram is the somatic, or physical, trigram. The primary inhabitants of the physical trigram tend to have corporeal bodies, a requirement of linear causality, and the weakest (but most flexible) attachment to sources of mana. The second trigram is the chronetic, or temporal, trigram. While it's predicted that beings with mobility through all three temporal axes exist, due to their inherent violation of causality they're impossible to observe via traditional methods. The final trigram is the noetic, or spiritual, trigram. Members of this trigram can have either corporeal or incorporeal forms and tend to be more intrinsically tied to concepts and ideals.

### §3.2 An Observation of the Three Tribes, or a Proposal for Unification Across the Nine Axes

Simple observation of the somatic, noetic, and chronetic tribes@footnote(1, pre-advancement, of course) presents an obvious narrative: three groups coexisting in the same space yet isolated by their inadequate sensoria. To expound, take the somatic tribe -- highly proficient within the physical trigram@footnote(2, the x, y, and z axes) but heavily restricted within the temporal trigram@footnote(3, the t, þ, and ϑ axes), and completely unable to move or perceive the spiritual trigram@footnote(4, the ℵ, ⨳, and ⅊ axes).

Since each of the three trigrams support the proper information density required for intelligent life, there's little environmental pressure for the evolution of a proper sensorium able to discern the other axes. As such, many beings go their entire lifetimes unaware of the other tribes. <span class="text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-slate-900 to-slate-300">However, interesting research into augmentation of the sensorium through arcanic means...</span>
