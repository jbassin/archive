A Crystal Sphere is the most common kind of locality found within the Astra. Spheres are categorized by a great shell of opaque white crystal containing some celestial bodies within. Each sphere has different rules by which one can manifest, and no two spheres are identical.

The shell of a Crystal Sphere varies from one locality to the next. Some spheres are completely impermeable, forming a single, smooth surface around their inhabitants. Others are adorned with rough patches and spikes, and some even have a form of tectonic activity, with plates that shift against each other. A common (but not ubiquitous) pattern is tiny pinpricks that connect the outside and inside of a shell, but traversal through those ports is generally quite difficult.
