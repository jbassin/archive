Yantho was a human with bright blue eyes, heavy scarring across the left half of his face, and a large, teal tattoo of a dragon across his arms and upper torso.

Yantho was a mid-ranking member of RDRco, responsible for the northern expansion of the rail by Fort Sera. He was assassinated on a train headed south after securing the expansion by Burr, a mind-controlled member of the Ghost Coal Chain Gang.
