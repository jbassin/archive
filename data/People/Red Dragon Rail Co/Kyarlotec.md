Kyarlotec is an umbryl with light gray skin covered in red tattoos. His eyes are mirrored such that one cannot tell where he is looking.

While Kyarlotec is currently an administrator for RDRco, he is also a vampire thrall and used to be part of the Salubra Cabal. He is estranged, however, and does not appear to be maintaining ties with anyone within the cabal.
