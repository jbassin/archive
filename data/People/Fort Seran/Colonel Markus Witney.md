Col. Witney is a grizzled, battle-scarred dwarf from the Gulch. He keeps his uniform in pristine condition, with nary a speck of dust despite working in a desert canyon.

Witney is the second-highest ranking soldier in Fort Sera and was their representative for negotiations with RDRco in the northern part of the Gulch.
