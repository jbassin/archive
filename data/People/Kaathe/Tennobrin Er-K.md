Tenno is a Kaathe with extensive memory loss. His orb is located somewhere inside a dream in Haven, but he currently resides in Hali's orb and has been there as long as he can remember.

Tenno is a light blue glowing, floating, glass orb in the real world, but is a twelve-foot tall, white-metal and ceramic construct in his dream. He wears a white cloak that obscures his body, but the smooth, featureless faceplate on his head is still clearly visible. His face is surrounded by two crossed, slowly rotating rings of blue runes.

Tenno is generally laid-back, and has a general innocence that belies his great age.
