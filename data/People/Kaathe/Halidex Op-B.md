Hali is a Kaathe with extensive memory loss. Her orb was kept in an Illyaran archive until it was shipped in secret to Aliaksandr Sarken. After a series of thefts and counter-thefts, the orb now resides in the hands of the Weft, who are currently searching out its twin for Tenno.

Hali is a red-glowing, floating, glass orb in the real world, but is a twelve-foot tall, dark-metal and ceramic construct in her dream. She wears a cloak that shades her face, but her single, red-glowing eye is visible in the cowl. Her head is surrounded by a slowly rotating ring of red runes.

Hali is generally harsh and curt, and while she shows an obvious disdain for "meatbags" like the Weft she's still willing to work with them to further her own goals.
