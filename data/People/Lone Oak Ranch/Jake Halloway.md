Jake "Sureshot" Halloway is an outlaw wanted for disorderly conduct, vagrancy, bribery, assault with a deadly weapon, railway larceny, and cardsharping. Rumored to be able to hit a tin can from 1000 paces with a hand pistol, Halloway had a brief stint as a stunt gunman before turning to his current life of crime. While few still remember his days as a performer, he still tends to bring a little flair to his robberies with dramatic entrances and a trademark checkered outfit for his gang.

Halloway has a small, but vocal, fan group in the southern part of Salores.

Halloway is a heavy-muscled human male with piercing blue eyes, skin tanned to leather, and wild muttonchops that extend inches off his face.
