Alexander is an oneiromancer and artificer under Lady Grave's employ -- although he also has ties to the Broker. His claim to fame is being part of the team that discovered how to make aqua fortis: the primary component of gunpowder. Unfortunately, he has no business sense and was the only member of his team unable to parlay that success into personal wealth (while his labmates are now all very rich, he still lives in relative squalor and survives grant-to-grant under the Trust).

Alexander is a wrinkled, old human male. He has wispy gray hair, only one functioning slate-colored eye, and a preference for old-fashioned robes instead of the new coats that many of his contemporary researchers use.
