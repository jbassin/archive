Archie is a friendly middle-aged, dwarven male with a penchant for launching metal slugs faster than the sound barrier. He owns the Hammer & Pin, which he uses both as a storefront as well as dry storage for his multiple tonnes of gunpowder. If you asked him, he'd say that his best friend is his Hester & Sons<sup>Â®</sup> .44 Albatross, due to its high firepower and inability to cheat on him.

Archie is a 4'7" dwarf with a long red beard, a bulbous nose, a shiny, bald head, and a set of ~30 singed overalls that he rotates through.
