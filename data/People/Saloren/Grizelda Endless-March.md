dsp: Grizelda Endless-March
---

Grizelda is a middle-aged female orc. She managed a small trading caravan that travelled between Salores and the small mining towns in the badlands.

At a rest-stop taken turing her final trip, a Khulakahn ambushed her caravan, killing her three compatriots@footnote(1, Harvey Hemmingwright, Aenne Mont Rey, and Tellulah). She gave up the trade after the incident.
