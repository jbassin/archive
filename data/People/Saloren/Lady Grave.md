Marquessa Calliana Anatal Grave (colloquially known as Lady Grave) is the highest-ranked noble in Toleros and a member of the Triptych. She rose to power due to her monopoly over the saltpetre mines in the Lunae Badlands making her a crucial part of the gunpowder production process. Since her ascent to power, Grave has invested heavily in research of and around combustion, and now funds a non-negligible portion of Toleros' scientific community.

Grave is a human Oread with jet skin crisscrossed by veins of reflective gold. She has harsh facial features, a sharp nose, golden hair, and eyes made of topaz.
