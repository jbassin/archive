Reverend Ezekiel Grimm is the founder and spiritual leader of Haven and the Church of the Thirteenth Realm.

Grimm is a young-looking elven male with slicked-back black hair and thick-framed glasses. He has a glowing halo and set of white, feathered wings as is common with the members of the Church of the Thirteenth Realm. He is short statured and soft spoken, but can still command a room when he needs to.
