Burr is a female, red-scaled kobold of about 10 years. She's originally from Junction, but Anatoli Suvchek identified her engineering talents and saved her from a life in the mines.

Burr was mind-controlled by a bioarcanically engineered creature living in her stuffed animal, and assassinated Yantho. She has no recollection of the events.
