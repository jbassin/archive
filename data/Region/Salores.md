Salores is the result of generations of stubborn people digging their heels into the ground instead of giving way to the forces of nature. Most of the land in Salores is a saltwater marsh that provides little stable ground to build upon. In addition, a miles-high wave that forms on the eastern side of the continent and travels across the globe crashes upon the country's shores every few weeks. Sourcing food is difficult too -- most livestock cannot survive in the knee-high waters of the marsh, only some hardy mosses and seaweed can grow in the salty ground, and the Tidal effectively prohibits fishing. The area is altogether poorly suited for a civilization.

Despite this, the Salorens have prospered. Great cities built on stilts driven deep into the ground appear to float just above the water. Massive storm breaks spike out of the western side of any large structure, dispersing the force of the Tidal. Animals and plants are magically altered to survive better in the marsh and Saloren cuisine has gotten very creative with seaweed. Despite the adverse conditions eroding any relics from previous cycles that might have given the Salorens an edge, artificers and inventors have put out new technologies at a record pace allowing the country to keep up with those around it. The most important of these inventions is gunpowder.

Gunpowder gives Salores an edge over its opponents, and the sulfur and saltpeter needed to make it can only be found in the marsh. The Triptych (the three aristocrats currently in power) keep an iron grip on the export of the substance out of the country, which has allowed them to negotiate very favorable trade agreements -- but is a point of great contention with neighboring countries.
