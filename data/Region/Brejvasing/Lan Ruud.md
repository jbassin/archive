The overground capital of Brejvasing. The "city" is barely more than a town, with only a few thousand sitting at the entrance to Brejvasing proper within the Leviathan. The entrance to the rest of the city is jealously guarded by its inhabitants, and the few visitors that are allowed to get near the entrance are only able to do so at the invitation of a respected member of the community.
