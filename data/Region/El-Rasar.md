El-Rasar is two nations within one. The northern half of the country is within Vaxan's nexus. Floating cities pulled out of the mountains below drift far above the ground, kept in place by sturdy chains affixed to the ground. The cities here are primarily mining-focused, relying on the rich ore veins in the mountains below. Despite the difficulty of their trade, northern El-rasarans are famous for their levity -- jokes fly as freely as they do through the supernaturally light air. El-rasaran parties are known continent-wide for being overly raucous and lasting for weeks (exacerbated by the fact that it's a holiday nearly every other day there).

While the northern half of El-Rasar can party their days away and bask in the riches from their precious metal and gemstone mines, the southern half struggles to survive amidst the harsh desert clime. Water is scarce and dries up frequently, leading to a mostly nomadic lifestyle for many southern El-rasarans. Vaati's nexus here leads to more bristly personalities and makes travel throughout the wastes to be extremely difficult for any but the most experienced travelers. Those who do survive, however, gain the skillset needed to travel through nearly any environment. Southern El-rasarans are highly sought-after guides.
