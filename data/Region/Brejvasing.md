From a distance, Brejvasing doesn't look like much. Its one town, Lan Ruud, is a quarter the size of other country's capitals; and its citizens rarely visit other cities. As such, rumors about the illusive Brejvasens run rampant in other parts of the continent -- ranging from mundane stereotypes about their accent or barbarism to more strange Brejvasen conspiracies to rule the world.

The fact of the matter is very few people have seen a Brejvasen because they tend not to live above ground. Most of Brejvasing is subterranean, built into the interior of a hundreds-mile-long serpentine superstructure from a previous cycle. The walls of the structure give off heat and light, protecting the inhabitants from the frozen tundras of the southern pole. An intricate, arcane network of trams facilitates movement through the structure and enchanted greenhouses allow for the cultivation of food deep underground. While the Brejvasens haven't figured out how to operate much of the ancient functionality of the structure, they've uncovered enough to support a large populace.

The Elders, a group of the oldest members of the various cities within the structure, have suggested an isolationist policy to their citizens. They fear that if word spreads that Brejvasing sits within a veritable treasure-trove of pre-cycle technology it could bring unwanted attention from other countries. They've managed to stay out of the public eye by just not getting involved, and don't want a possible disruption to their way of life.
