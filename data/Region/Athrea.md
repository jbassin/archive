Athrea is less a country and more a roiling mass of ever-shifting alliances and backstabbing between short-lived duchies. The populace of Athrea is concentrated in the densely forested region central to western Althane but there are claims in the grassland areas further west and the mountainous region to the east. Sunnok's nexus is constantly moving throughout the region; both contributing to and exacerbating the near-constant flux of power between rival cities.

Cities rise and fall rapidly in Athrea as their nobles find themselves on the wrong end of a spear from rival houses or an internal coup. This means that while the physical structures may be old, their governments and rulers are young. As such, many find it convenient to refer only to a city by name instead of the current house in power. The three strongest duchies are Thyropae, Ialassa, and Lantium. These are, coincidentally, the ones with nobles who have held onto their power the longest.

While one might think that the constant change and threat of war might cow the denizens of Athrea, it's under these conditions that they thrive. Merchants ply their trade without regard for the ruling house, and artists are inspired by the tumultuous change that occurs so frequently. Athrea's central location makes it the premier cultural powerhouse of its part of the continent, despite (or perhaps because of) its turmoil.
