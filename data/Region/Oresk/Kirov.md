The capital city of Oresk and the seat of power for the Kommandant. The city is a living dichotomy of beautiful roads and buildings, warm and inviting homes and restaurants, and a vibrant populace juxtaposed with deadly cold, the ever-hanging spectre of famine, an invasive police state, and air that literally drains the emotion out of those who breathe it.

Despite its location in one of the harshest environs on Althane, Kirov is a bustling city with some of the most advanced agricultural, medical, and military technology on the continent -- not that the government would allow others to make use of it.
