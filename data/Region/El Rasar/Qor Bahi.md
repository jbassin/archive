Qor Bahi is the capital of El-Rasar and is famous worldwide for its extravagant parties and lavish displays of wealth. The city is built atop a massive floating slab of rock chained to the ground by tonnes of chain, to prevent it from floating away. The city floats above rich veins of precious metals and rare minerals, and near everyone in the city interacts with the material from the mines in some way -- excavating it, working it, or spending it.
