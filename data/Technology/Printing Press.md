The printing press was created in 672 by a Saloren arcanist in Toleros. Using a mix of arcane machinery and steam-powered hydraulics, it can imprint text and images rapidly onto specially made, thin parchment in a fraction of the time that traditional transcription takes.

While the Saloren government attempted to keep this tech within its borders, some Athrean spies managed to smuggle the plans out of the country, which caused it to be rapidly disseminated across the continent. While the technology is still fairly new, its ease of use and cost-effectiveness has made its adoption inevitable.
