The advent of railways and trains in the Occident has drastically shrunk the time it takes to move and communicate between different countries. While the technology is still fairly new (railways only connect major cities â€” smaller towns still need to be navigated to on foot or horseback), major trade routes have already sprung up between countries that otherwise would have nothing to do with each other.

The largest railway currently is an intra-continental rail that connects Kirov and Vallastela.
