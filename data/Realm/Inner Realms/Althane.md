Althane is the most populous realm in the Crystal Sphere and is home to the greatest diversity of inhabitant races. The surface is 32% land, the majority of which is concentrated in a single supercontinent that stretches from near the planet's southern pole up past its equator. The terrain on the planet varies from jungles and deserts at the northern tip to frozen tundras in the south; with mountain ranges, temperate forests, expansive marshlands, and an inland lake large enough to support navies and maritime trade.

Althane is tidally locked with its twin Ilkyne, and as such doesn't rotate about its poles, but instead orbits around a central point between the paired worlds. Due to their proximity, Ilkyne takes up a large part of the sky and is always visible.
