Ilkyne is a terrestrial planet like Althane -- albeit slightly larger. It has much harsher weather patterns than most of Althane and is covered near-completely in dense cloud cover, making mapping the surface remotely impossible. Bursts of red lightning can be seen within the clouds, and a great shadow can sometimes be seen moving on the surface.
