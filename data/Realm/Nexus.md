There are parts of Althane that are connected to a realm more deeply than anywhere else. These locations are called nexes, and the area around a particular realm's nexus exhibits the properties of that realm. This includes (but is not limited to) weather patterns, geography, local inhabitants, modifications to regular physics, and emotional responses.
