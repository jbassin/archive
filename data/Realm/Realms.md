Manifestation in Althane is rooted in Althane, Ilkyne, and their twelve orbiting realms. Spellcasters, magical creatures, and other entities with the capacity to Manifest power their abilities by drawing upon one of the realms. Depending on the aspect of the realm used, different effects can be observed. For instance, spells that draw from Udasil — the aspect of Decay — can freeze the ground, calm emotions, and drain vigor.

There are twelve natural satellites orbiting around the central twin planets. Each follows a sharp elliptical orbit that takes it on a sweeping path throughout the sphere, sometimes drawing very close to one of the two planets and sometimes pushing very far away. When a realm is closest to Althane it's in conjunction, and when it's furthest it's in opposition.

Each satellite — called a realm — Manifests some aspect and affects the presence of that aspect on Althane. For example, Vazan is the realm of Weight. When Vazan is in conjunction the world feels heavier: sky creatures have a harder time flying, inhabitants are more serious and somber, mudslides and cave collapses are more common, and decisions made are more likely to stick. On the other hand, when Vazan is in opposition, creatures can jump almost twice as high as they normally do, jokes land better than they might otherwise, and parties can last for much longer than normal.
