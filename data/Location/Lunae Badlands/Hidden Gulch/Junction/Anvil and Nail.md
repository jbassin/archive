The Anvil and Nail is a large smeltery and forge in the heart of junction. The building has three floors packed full of bellows and anvils, and can be seen from across the town due to the massive papier-mâché anvil mounted to the roof.

Inside the shop one can either sell the raw metals they've excavated from the mines around the town, or they can pay to have their metals refined and crafted into something useful.
