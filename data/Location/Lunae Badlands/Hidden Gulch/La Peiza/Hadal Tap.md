The Hadal Tap is an ancient pumping system from a previous cycle that surfaces water for drinking in La Peiza. It was infected with a chaos beast that had emerged from below, but an adventuring party defeated the beast, cleaning the water.

Below the tap is a monitoring station partially constructed in a dream, with an interface for a Kaathe orb. The monitoring station was constructed partially from the SSV Trip the Light Fantastic.
