Junction is a mining town located in the center of the gulch. Rails from all three rail companies pass through the town, and the most direct route to Haven is a straight-shot south.

Junction was originally just a set of mines built into the canyon walls, but as more people arrived from across the gulch it expanded -- both outward and upward, carving its way right into the cliff face. Nowadays the town is one of the largest population centers for miles, and is considered the center for aeternalis trade.
