The Hidden Gulch is a series of canyons embedded into the southern portion of the Lunae Badlands. Rumors of hazardous terrain and ravenous monsters keep out most would-be travelers, and magic gates within the canyons prevent entry to all but those who carry aeternalis -- a mineral only found within the gulch. As such, outsiders generally require a guide to gain access.
