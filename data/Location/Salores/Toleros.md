A bustling frontier city in Salores. Currently ruled by Lady Grave, a merchant who rose to power overseeing the city's shift to gunpowder production.

The city is built atop bedrock carted from the east to shore up the ground against the muddy fen. Travel around the city is mostly on foot or via skimmers designed to travel across the few-foot-deep channels that pass through the city.
