No Man's Land is the land bridge between the Occident and the landmass to the east. It's a 300-mile stretch of land guarded by the mechanical and arcane guardians of some civilization long past that make traversing the area nearly impossible. The guardians' influence extends to the airspace above the region, as well as through the water to the north and south. The safest route between the two halves of the continent is through the island to the north -- although there's no small amount of danger that way too.
