Illyara is a prosperous city-state built on an island in the middle of an inland sea. The city is built atop the ruins of what was likely a highly advanced metropolis in a former cycle; as such it's found a rapid rise to power in the region (thanks to great artifacts uncovered throughout the years). The most important of these artifacts is The Crystalpoint Lattice: a vast, magical intelligence imprinted onto a suspended mesh of crystal. The Lattice serves as the ruler of the city, and its operators interpret and implement its decrees as it steers the city into the future.

Illyara boasts one of the largest economies across all of Althane due to its control of the Ghostrime Sea in which it resides. An ancient mechanism discovered by the Illyarans (and used at the behest of the Lattice) allows Illyara to control the weather across the sea. The city demands fairly steep taxes and fees for travel across the ocean, and ships that don't pay may find themselves frozen in place, unable to proceed until they cough up some coin.
