refs: the creed | the bloody

The Creed of Ichor and Essence (colloquially known as either the Creed or the Bloody, depending on one's opinion of the organization) doesn't worship any of the realms, but instead looks within and worships the self. They believe that the divine spark is present in everyone, and that power comes from self-discipline and improvement instead of relying on outward factors.
