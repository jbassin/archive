The Twin Lights is a belief system focused on the pairing of Althane and Ilkyne. Their scripture focuses heavily on the idea of “do unto others,” with the belief that every good action one perpetrates has a twin that is returned in time. Equivalently, negative actions are similarly returned in kind. Followers of the Twin Lights can commonly be seen acting as medics on battlegrounds and in the poorer parts of cities, where medical attention is needed most.
