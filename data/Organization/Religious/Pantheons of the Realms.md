The Pantheon of the Realms is the collective name for the twelve different temples that worship one of the orbiting realms around Althane. Each one focuses on their realm's Aspect and acolytes of the faith try to embody the Aspect as best as they can. This leads to variations in the different temples; for example, while a temple to Dahn may be the traditional structure that one might expect, temples to Kybal look closer to workshops than places of worship, and temples to Udasil are generally also gravesites.

### The Different Temples and Their Services

The services a temple to a particular realm may provide to the local populace varies greatly depending on its chief priest's interpretation of what the realm expects of them. Many provide essential services, like healing and smithing; while some may offer stranger experiences, like soothsaying and aesthetic surgery. Some temples are so far removed from any particular religious doctrine that many who visit don't even realize that they're in a religious location.
