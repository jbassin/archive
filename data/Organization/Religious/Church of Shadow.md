The Church of the Shadow believes that while Lacuna perished, it didn't lose its divinity. Its sheer power gave sentience to its own shadow, which lived on after the creation of the world. The Church follows The Shadow, which supposedly maintains the world order to ensure that Lacuna's vision lives on. Just as the Shadow keeps order from the dark, members of the Church themselves work to keep the world on the path they choose. Many members of the Church tend to take careers either in politics or in the underworld, choosing whichever way they can to exert their control on the world.
