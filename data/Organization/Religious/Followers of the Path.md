refs: heroes of the path

A Follower of the Path is anyone who puts their faith in one of the four Templar orders of Althane. The orders can trace their heritage back to a group of four heroes who fought a great evil -- and gained a piece of Lacuna in the process. While each of the four orders has different rites, hierarchies, and specific goals, they all cite rooting out evil as a motivating force.

While the original heroes and their order are from a cycle long before the current one, their fortresses have been discovered and revived by followers in the modern cycle. As each fortress has a map that points to the other three, it's believed that this isn't the first cycle in which that's happened.
