The Church of the Thirteenth Realm is based in Haven, and is lead by Reverend Grimm. They preach about a paradise granted to them by a hidden realm that orbits Althane and Ilkyne.

The ministers and law enforcement of the church are called Guardian Angels. All angels appear to be Aasimar, with halos or wings betraying their station from a distance. Curiously, the angels are able to cast spells without developing the telltale spellrings in their eyes.
