Eagle-eye<sup>速</sup> is a single person with a workshop in the Kettin Forests that makes hyper-accurate sniper rifles. No one knows the identity of the proprietor, and the only time they've been seen in public is when they demonstrated one of their firearms by hitting a target 1000 feet away.

### Eagle-eye<sup>速</sup> .32 Trueshot

Designed for hunting big game, these rifles are consistent and accurate, but new rounds must be manually loaded with a bolt on the top of the gun, greatly slowing their firing rate.

### Eagle-eye<sup>速</sup> .50 Longshot

The Longshot has an antigravity rune on the bottom of the barrel making it the only gun on the market where bullets don't fall over time. It also has recoil greater than nearly any other firearm, limiting use to stationary, tripod-only operation.
