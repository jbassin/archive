At one point the Guild was called the Guild for the Greater Good, but it eventually became so ubiquitous throughout the realm that whenever someone mentioned "The Guild" everyone else already knew what they were talking about. The Guild is an organization of adventurers, mercenaries, and heroes that are willing to throw themselves into mortal danger to protect others. Members of the Guild have special privileges that allow them to pass quickly through border customs and get discounts at some supply shops. In exchange, local governments hold the Guild on retainer for when a monster makes its home near their towns or a bandit camp is formed on a trade route.

### Guild Rankings

To ensure that an inexperienced adventuring party doesn't bite off more than they can chew, the Guild gates incoming requests behind ranking requirements. Newbie adventurers will likely only be able to take small-fry quests, while high-ranked members have greater access to requests. One can skip the line if they have a recommendation from a high-ranking member, or if they have evidence of their prowess.

### Extralegal Status

While the Guild isn't beholden to the legal system of any one country in which it operates, to improve relations it tends not to entertain requests that would be explicitly illegal in the location where the request is received. It also maintains an internal list of requests that are banned, regardless of the country of origin. This includes assassinations, burglary, arson, and racketeering.
