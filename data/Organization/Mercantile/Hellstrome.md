Hellstrome is a rail company headquartered in Deadman's Vale. Their train engines all have names associated with them.

Hellstrome employees don't have a standard uniform, but they're often accompanied by undead who where orange rags with the company's logo on them -- a chunk of aeternalis on fire.
