Xanthoura is a guild of assassins operating out of the Aumana Wastes. Famously, a guildmember killed the entire Saloren Triptych during a public address by enchanting their clothes to strangle them. No member of the Xanthoura knows any other member except their direct subordinates; instead, a complex message-passing system is used to distribute targets across the organization.

### Requesting a Hit

If they're a secret organization, how do they receive job requests and payment? Excellent question! There are rumors that if one writes their request down on parchment in their blood and burns it, a member of the Xanthoura will be notified of the request, and can decide to take the job or not.
