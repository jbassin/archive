Hammerhead<sup>®</sup> is a firearm producer with a factory in Toleros. Hammerheads are famously "point-and-click" where a single slug can clear a room and backpressure runes nearly eliminate recoil.

### Hammerhead® .72 Scattergun

A classic design, which loads two slugs or shells into separate barrels, the scattergun trades ammo capacity and range for reliability and sheer firepower.

### Hammerhead® .78 Homewrecker

The ever-reliable Homewrecker scattergun features a distinctive sliding grip on the front of the barrel which can be 'pumped' to chamber a new round. The simplicity of this design both improves reliability and reduces cost, while allowing the scattergun to accept different ammunition, such as nonlethal rounds.

### Hammerhead® .78 Typhoon

This variant of a scattergun has dramatically shortened barrels, increasing the weapon’s spread to make it deadlier in close-combat. The reduced range ruins this weapon for hunting but transforms it into an ad-hoc trench gun, suitable for urban warfare.
