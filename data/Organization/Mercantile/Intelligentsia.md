Intelligentsia is a collective of philosophers, painters, poets, and more devoted to other creative crafts. While their Chateau is in Qor Bahi in El-Rasar, there are chapters of the group across the continent. The organization seeks to increase the total amount of beauty in the world, however, the definition of beauty is left to the individual that is enacting said change.

Examples of Beauty

There are many, varied interpretations of the Intelligentsia's goal. One famous artist planted eighty-seven different species of tree in a single grove in the middle of the desert, while another combined the body of a bear with the head of an owl and set it loose in the middle of Vallastela, and a third sculpted marble statues of every member of the Brejvasaran Elders in compromising positions. There's no correct way to express one's self to the Intelligentsia, but they tend to respond well to audaciousness.
