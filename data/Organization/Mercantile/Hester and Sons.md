Hester & Sons<sup>®</sup> is a family-owned firearms manufacturer based out of Vallastela. They specialize in a range of handguns of all sizes, to prepare the average user for any dangerous situation. A snippet of their selection is below:

### Hester & Sons<sup>®</sup> .17 Hornet

The hornet is a very small, easily concealable firearm that can be produced at a moment’s notice. It loads only one (and in some variants two) bullets at a time, which might cripple it in a lengthy firefight, but seldom matters when coupled with the element of surprise.

### Hester & Sons<sup>®</sup> .22 Quill

Portable, reliable, and with a rotating cylinder packed with 10 bullets, the quill is an excellent firearm for self-defense. Though it might struggle to contend with a scattergun or albatross, the humble quill is more than sufficient for the city guard, and can be fired by a civilian in danger in a pinch.

### Hester & Sons<sup>®</sup> .38 Sparrow

An iconic handgun, the sparrow stores six bullets in a rotating cylinder, which can be fired in rapid succession. This weapon is favored by gunslingers for its reliability and stopping power.

### Hester & Sons<sup>®</sup> .44 Albatross

Nothing is more commanding than an Albatross. This revolver is chambered for large-caliber bullets, and firing it feels like directing an explosion at a target while a mule attempts to kick the gun from your hand. Its weight and heft stand testament to the fact that it is the most powerful handgun money can buy.
