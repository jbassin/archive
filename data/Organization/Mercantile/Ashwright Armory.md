The Ashwright Armory<sup>速</sup> is a firearm and armor producer operating out of the ruins of an antecyclic manufactory in Salores. Harlan Ashwright, the founder, operates under the principle that more is more. As such firearms coming out of the armory hit hard and hit often and their armor can take a real beating. Some of their weapons are below:

### Ashwright Armory<sup>速</sup> .38 Pepperbox

A weapon infamous for its rate of fire, the pepperbox rotates its many barrels, which fire in sequence, to manage the tremendous heat from sustained automatic fire. This weapon is cumbersome, easily recognizable, and utterly terrifying all at the same time.

### Ashwright Armory<sup>速</sup> 2.30 Handcannon

The 2.30 Handcannon: for when you want to kill everything in a general direction.
