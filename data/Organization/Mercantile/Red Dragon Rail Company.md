The Red Dragon Rail Company is a locomotive operator in the hidden gulch. They have nominal control over the south-western part of the canyons, including everything south and left of New Opportunity.

The company makes extensive use of undead for their rail construction and maintenance, and are currently in the middle of a minor turf war with Fort Sera to the north. Their uniforms are orange and teal, and tend to be tied around the waist, exposing the chest.
