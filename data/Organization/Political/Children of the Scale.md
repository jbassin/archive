The Children of the Scale are a longstanding group that has argued against a disparity between magic users and everyone else, believing that non-spellcasters are treated as second-class citizens in many parts of the world.

While they were mostly ignored by many for most of the group’s lifetime, in recent years the advent of the Printing Press has allowed them to better distribute their message, increasing their numbers and outreach. In addition, the gun has given them a way to fight back against their oppressors, often in violent fashion — drastically increasing tension in Salores in recent years.
