The Triptych is the three ruling members of Salores as well as their cabinet of administrators. Everyone in the Triptych is part of the same political faction, and during changes of power the entire group is replaced by the incoming faction. The Triptych is selected from a pool of about 80 different parties by that same pool; a change of power happens whenever any one faction can gain a majority of support from the pool.

The previous ruling faction was the Rose faction, but with the advent of firearms the current ruling Progress Faction took control, and has held it since.
