Moralism was first introduced as an ideology in the year 314 by an Oreskian philosopher. It preaches the idea of a community acting as a single collective, where each individual's contributions are shared amongst the whole. This idea was subsequently spread throughout the continent and was quickly twisted into new and completely unrelated shapes to best fit the needs of the local, power-hungry despot. The largest of these bastardizations is the Moralists' Union, a group of thugs who have taken it upon themselves to forcibly enroll smaller businesses into the Union, with mandatory monthly dues for little upside. Business owners who refuse to pay their dues find their goods being stolen, their shops burning down, and their knees being shattered.

### The Good Moralists

There are instances of Moralism being implemented well in pockets across the continent. Unfortunately, the Moralists' Union is the first (and usually only) thing people think of when they hear about Moralism, which makes it harder to spread in its purest form.
