The Network is a group of informants and spies working under the Broker to maximize information distribution to their wealthy clients. Due to their less-than-legal activities, the organization doesn't advertise, and many people go their entire lives without interacting with the group as a whole.

Members of the Network operate in small cells, and members of one cell don't know anything about the other cells. The location of the group is unknown, but they're active in most parts of the Occident.
