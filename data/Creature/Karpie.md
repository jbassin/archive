Karpies are bioarcanically engineered fish designed to traverse the shallow, muddy fens of Salores. They're easy to steer and feed, and due to a mistake in their creation they have absolutely no self-preservation instinct.

Karpies are fish the size of an ox with three legs to a side and the ability to break air. They tend to come in orange, black, and white colorations.
