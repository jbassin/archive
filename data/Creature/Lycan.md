Lycans are the class of creatures that can transform (either partially or wholly) into an animal. Lesser lycans can't control their transformation and are often hunted down for endangering the populace where they live. Greater lycans have much better control, and can even receive great increases in power depending on which of the realms is in conjunction.

As lycans age they become more powerful. After some unknown point, lycans begin to mutate, gaining supernatural power not inherent to the animal which they take their power from. The oldest lycans are all unique, with individual abilities that give them an edge over others. It's recommended to equip oneself with silvered weaponry and to fight during the day; but when encountering an elder lycan the best course of action is to run.
