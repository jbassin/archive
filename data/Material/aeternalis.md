Æternalis -- known colloquially as ghost coal -- is a chalky white substance with flecks of green metal embedded throughout. It burns cleanly into a hot, green flame that faintly hums instead of crackling. The ghost coal burns for an extremely long time; famously, a chalice of the stuff has sat (lit) on the steps of Haven for years without exhausting its fuel supply.

The only known location of æternalis veins in the Occident is within the Hidden Gulch, but various interested parties have smuggled out small amounts over the past two decades.
