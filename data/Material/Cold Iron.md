Contrary to what the name would imply, cold iron isn't iron at all. Cold iron is a magic iron alloy developed by some antecyclic civilization that can pierce fey, fiend, and lycan natural protections. While introducing heat can melt cold iron and allow it to be smelted, the metal itself stays at exactly 53Â° no matter what the external temperature is.
