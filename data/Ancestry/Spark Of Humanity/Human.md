Humans are the most malleable of the races, able to adapt to near-any environment and get along with basically anything that has a face (and sometimes things that don't). Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, map the expanse of the sphere, search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors -- for no better reason than because they can.

Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.

Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 80 years old.
