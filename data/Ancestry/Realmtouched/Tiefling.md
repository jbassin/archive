Tieflings are touched by Vikar and have a connection to the aspect of Progress. Tieflings show characteristics that reflect the features of many of the creatures that call Vikar home, which endears them to those that worship Vikar and greatly harms their chances with those that don't. For those born to ignorant or fearful parents, childhood is particularly hard, but even those whose families accept and nurture them face fear and prejudice from society as a whole.

No two tieflings look quite the same; but, they all carry some variation of beastlike features. These variations never make a tieflingâ€™s appearance so strange as to obscure their humanoid ancestry, but horns, a forked tongue, vestigial wings, a tail, or a cloven hoof in place of a foot are all common and obvious signs of their heritage.
