Aasimar are touched by Davar and have a connection to the aspect of Providence. Aasimar are thought to be supremely blessed with strength of will, extraordinary beauty, and innate magical gifts; but many aasimar find that these perceived talents -- whether they truely have them or not -- set them apart from their friends and family, fostering loneliness in themselves and jealousy in others. Aasimar with a positive outlook face these challenges by serving their communities, populating the environment with kindness or artwork, or simply supporting those who are less fortunate. Some aasimar hold a more hostile worldview, however, and risk falling into resentment, despair, or even the temptations of evil. Even then, the stereotypes surrounding an aasimar cling close, causing others to view them as tragic figures in need of redemption.

An aasimar’s physical appearance depends as much upon the features of their parents as it does upon the nature of their celestial heritage. While an aasimar is recognizably a member of their humanoid ancestry, they always bear a few physical traits that set them apart, such as glowing eyes, a faint halo of light above their head, feathers for hair, antennae on the brow, a metallic sheen to the skin, lack of a navel, a strangely musical voice, or a naturally pleasing floral scent. It’s a common stereotype that all aasimar are handsome or beautiful.
