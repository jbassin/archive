Duskwalkers are touched by Udasil and have a connection to the aspect of Decay. Duskwalkers have an inherent understanding of the %cycle of life and death. In most cases, this manifests as a deep respect for that %cycle and pushes the duskwalker toward occupations that help them to protect it, such as hunters of the undead, midwives, morticians, and priests. Duskwalkers are extremely rare -- Udasil seems to only connect with a restricted number of people at any one time, placing a cap on the total number of duskwalkers at the lower double-digits.

There is a belief that duskwalkers are spirits that Udasil chose to give another chance, and as such many duskwalkers believe that they had a life before their current one. While some choose to seek out their previous life, others leave it behind and live a new life.

Duskwalkers keep the physical characteristics of their parents, with the notable exception of their pale blue skin with dark patterning on the limbs and torso. No two duskwalkers have the same patterning.

To play a duskwalker, use the [duskwalker](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=25) ruleset.
