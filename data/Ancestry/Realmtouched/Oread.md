Oreads are touched by Vazan and have a connection to the aspect of Weight. Oreads can be slow to reveal their true selves, or perhaps more accurately, have enough depth and mystery inherent to their beings that they can reveal new and unexpected facets of themselves every day. They usually feel that they personify certain aspects of earth, stone, or other sediments or minerals, such as a cliff's tenacious resilience against erosion, the generosity and nourishment of fertile soil, or the versatile utility of metal and stone.

Oreads have the same diversity in height, body type, and physical characteristics as any other member of their mortal ancestries, alongside a handful of other traits that distinguish them as realmtouched. Their skin is often gray or brown, but can also resemble metals and precious stones, with copper and iron veining or crystals that grow out of their skin. Instead of hair, oreads often have crystals or rocks that grow from their heads; regardless, most oreads sculpt, decorate, or otherwise maintain the appearance of their hair, whatever form it takes. Almost all oreads have shimmering gemstone eyes, beautiful and multifaceted.
