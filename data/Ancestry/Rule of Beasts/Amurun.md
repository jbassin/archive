Amurun are outgoing, active humanoids who delight in discovery, whether of hidden ruins or a comfortable place to nap. They are exceptionally social, both within their tight-knit communities and with other creatures they meet. Remarkably brave, amurun see themselves as guardians of the world against forces that would assail it, and they believe that strong communities, breadth of experience, and continual self-improvement aid them in this fight.

Although all amurun walk upright and have soft fur, a long tail, large ears, and vertical pupils, they show at least as much variety as ordinary felines. Amurun have nimble fingers with short claws that are usually retractable. Most amurun take great pride in maintaining their appearance and rarely suffer the indignity of being wet or dirty if they can avoid it. Amurun are rarely taller than the average human and, because of their lean builds, rarely weigh as much as a human of similar height.

Amurun mature quickly and can walk at only a few months old, but they otherwise start their careers at roughly the same age as humans do and live to be 60 or 70 years of age.
