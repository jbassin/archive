Sprites are diminutive, whimsical, and exuberant creatures from beyond. They love playing pranks, exploring new things, and embracing everything to do with magic. Sprites habitually live in tiny, reclusive villages in areas with abundant magic, natural beauty, or other curiosities of interest. Other sprites live as loners or with small family or peer groups, traveling across the land in search of excitement.

Sprites are tiny faeries whose features vary wildly based on their heritage. They slowly grow their wings over time as their magical potential manifests, though some never grow wings at all. Sprites reach adulthood at around the same rate as humans do, but a typical fey who can manage to stay out of mischief and danger can live to nearly 200 years.
