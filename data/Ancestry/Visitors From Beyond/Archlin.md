ipa: Arc-lin

Though familiar with the chaos of war, most archlins have orderly minds and prefer to live within established hierarchies. While many archlins consider sentimentality weak, those with mild temperaments have found success in diplomacy and international outreach. Even civilian groups such as farming collectives or trading houses organize into regiments, companies, and divisions. Most archlins fixate on social status, and many constantly strive to advance their social position.

Archlins stand nearly as tall as humans, though they tend to have shorter legs and longer arms and torsos. They have bald, wide heads, beady eyes, and gray skin that becomes steely blue when tanned. Archlins are remarkably hardy; they recover from illnesses quickly and can exert themselves for long periods with little difficulty.

Archlins mature quickly, and most can walk, talk, and hold a weapon by the time they are 1 year old, reaching adolescence by the age of 8 to 12 and adulthood around 14. Archlins typically live up to 70 years of age.
