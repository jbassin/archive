Itarii value ferocity, vengeance, and devotion above all else. Their dark, formidable wingspans and long history of taking revenge for their fallen family members have painted them as winged devils in the eyes of neighboring human populations. In contradiction to their misunderstood nature, itarii boast a spiritual, artistic, and compassionate culture that is rarely seen outside of their roosts.

Itarii are avian-influenced humanoids with intimidating talons and feathered wings sprouting from their backs. With an average height of 6 feet, itarii are taller than most humans but are very light for their size. They have pointed ears and large eyes that are typically black from sclera to pupil, but occasionally appear as a piercing golden color. Itarii cannot move their eyes independently of their head, resulting in distinctive jerky movements as their gaze snaps between targets. Their bodies are usually taut with defined musculature -- a result of the strength necessary to flex their wings. Itarii are considered mature at 14 years of age and have an average lifespan of 40 years.
