Dray move through the societies of other humanoids with the steely reserve of born predators. They have a well-deserved reputation as outstanding rangers and unsentimental fighters. Though dray have adapted to many different environments, many of them still prefer to remain near bodies of water, using their ability to hold their breath to their advantage. As a result, dray usually prefer equipment that is not easily damaged by moisture, eschewing leather and metal for gear made of stone, ivory, glass, and bone.

Dray vary depending on their ancestry but share toothy snouts and long and powerful tails. Dray tend to have either scales of vibrant colors or metallic sheens. Some dray have ornate, spiraling horns while others have swirling protrusions on their collarbones and upper torso. Dray reach physical adulthood at age 15 and live up to 120 years. The average dray stands 6 to 7 feet tall but grows throughout their lifetime, gaining strength and size with age.
