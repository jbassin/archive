Bes are eminently practical and pragmatic hunters and raiders. To bes, honor is just another word for pointless risk. Any loss of a bes affects not just the individual, but their packmates and kin as well. Wasting time on anything but victory, whether it's mercy or cruelty, is seen as little shy of immoral. Bes see effectiveness as a cardinal virtue and believe that the best fight is one that never gives the opponent a chance to strike back. The bes tend to be masters of ambushes, tactical feints, and psychological warfare.

Bes are large, hyena-like humanoids with short muzzles, sharp teeth, and large and expressive round ears. Their bodies are covered in shaggy fur, rougher on the back and softer and lighter on the stomach and throat, usually in an off-white, tan, or brown shade-spots and stripes are both common. Bes typically stand between six and seven feet tall. Women are usually about a head taller than men and are correspondingly stronger. Bes are considered adults at 15, and live about 60 years on average, though some can reach a hundred or more in good health.
