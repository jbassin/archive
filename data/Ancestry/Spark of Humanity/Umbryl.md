Umbryl are humans who made a pact with the Shadow long ago, allowing them to partially cross the veil between realms without completing the transition. These lithe and shadowy beings seem to sink and vanish into the gloom. They see in darkness, exercise control over shadows, and have strange occult powers.

Umbryl skin tones fall on a monochromatic scale from stark white to deep black, and all the shades of gray between. Their bodies are just as diverse in shape and size as humans, though most display a certain fluidity of motion reminiscent of shifting shadows. Umbryl's reflective, pupilless eyes can pierce darkness. An umbryl's most notable feature is their shadow, which seldom faithfully reflects their body. Instead, umbryl shadows might have incongruous shapes or sizes, while others flicker, move of their own accord, or imitate the shadow of another nearby creature. Umbryl mature at the same rate as humans, and have similar lifespans.
