Kithkin are humans who lived amongst the Mycelia, a magical fungal forest renowned for bestowing luck on its inhabitants. Optimistic and cheerful, blessed with uncanny luck, and driven by a powerful wanderlust, kithkin make up for their short stature with an abundance of bravado and curiosity. Despite their excitable but easygoing attitude, kithkin are highly skilled warriors. An individual kithkin might hunt a beast many times their size just for the sport of it, but even in the jaws of danger they rarely lose their sense of humor.

Kithkin are short humanoids who look vaguely like smaller humans. They rarely grow to be more than 3 feet in height. Kithkin proportions vary, with some looking like shorter adult humans with slightly larger heads and others having proportions closer to those of a human child.

Most kithkin prefer to walk barefoot rather than wearing shoes, and those who do so develop roughly calloused soles on their feet over time. Tufts of thick, often-curly hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet. Kithkin skin tones tend toward rich, tawny shades like amber or oak, and their hair color ranges from a light golden blond to raven black. Kithkin reach physical adulthood around the age of 20. A typical kithkin can live to be around 150 years old.
