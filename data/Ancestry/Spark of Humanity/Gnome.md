Gnomes were humans that long ago came into contact with the Zephyr, an ephemeral force of mutability. Always hungry for new experiences, gnomes constantly wander both mentally and physically, attempting to stave off a terrible ailment that threatens all of their people. This affliction -- the Bleaching -- strikes gnomes who fail to dream, innovate, and take in new experiences. The Bleaching slowly drains the color from gnomes, and it plunges those affected into states of deep depression that eventually claim their lives.

Most gnomes stand just over 3 feet in height and weigh little more than a human child. They exhibit a wide range of natural skin, hair, and eye colors. For gnomes that haven't begun the Bleaching, nearly any hair and eye color other than white is possible, with vibrant colors most frequent, while skin tones span a slightly narrower spectrum and tend toward earthy tones and pinkish hues, though occasionally green, black, or pale blue. Gnomesâ€™ large eyes and dense facial muscles allow them to be particularly expressive in their emotions.

Gnomes typically reach physical maturity at the age of 15, though many gnomes maintain a childlike curiosity about the world even into adulthood. Gnomes rarely live longer than around 60 years.
