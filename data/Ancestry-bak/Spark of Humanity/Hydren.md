Hydren are humans who adapted to live with the Tidal instead of building up fortifications to keep it out. Hydren have an air of inevitability about them, like anything they set out to do will eventually be accomplished, regardless of how long it takes. Hydren can be famously headstrong and self-assured, but their dogged persistence helps them complete tasks that others thought impossible.

Hydren appear as regal, athletic humans. Their soft, hydrophilic skin ranges in tones from pearlescent white to pinkish, greenish, or brown tones reminiscent of coral. Hydren with hair are somewhat rare; many sport fins or scaled ridges on their heads instead. They often have eyes in shades of lilac and lavender. Their aquatic lineage is obvious thanks to the sets of three gills on either side of their necks, as well as their webbed hands and feet. Hydren have been known to live longer than humans, although they mature at about the same rate.
