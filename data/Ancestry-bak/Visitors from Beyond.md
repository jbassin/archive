Some of the races on Althane aren't a derivative of humanity but instead came from somewhere beyond. Woefully, how they arrived and what they left behind has been lost by the Cycle, and modern visitor cultures likely share little with their origins. Despite their extraplanetary genesis, the visitor races have become well-integrated with the rest of the denizens of Althane.
