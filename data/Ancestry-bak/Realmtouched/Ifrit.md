Ifrit are touched by Ravic and have a connection to the aspect of Expansion. Ifrit have a metaphorical and literal fire burning in their chest, which spurs them to be passionate and impulsive. Ifrit always keep themselves moving and busy, traveling to new places or trying new things, for fear that slowing down may dim their inner fire. While there is a prevalent stereotype that all Ifrit are hotheaded and reckless, it is rooted in a kernel of truth -- an ifrit's impulse to move can make them restless if they ignore it for too long.

An ifrit's general form is the same as their parents, but red, orange, and brass are all common skin colors, while others have charcoal-gray, ash-brown, or radiant white, yellow, or blue hues. Ifrit hair often falls in untamable coils of flame that grow over the ifrit's lifespan.
