Item BS00001 ('Occult Skull') was acquired by a freelance group hired to encourage the Redrock Pass settlement to resume saltpetre shipments. The group reported finding a near-empty town, with only the mayor and two other survivors present. The freelancers tracked down a <span class="select-none rounded-lg" style="color: transparent; text-shadow: 0 0 8px #000;">wolf %lycan</span> responsible for decimating the settlement and dispatched it. The freelancers also investigated the mine itself, where they found the Occult Skull, as well as <span class="select-none rounded-lg" style="color: transparent; text-shadow: 0 0 8px #000;">four %Oreskian First House operatives</span>. The group obtained the Occult Skull and returned to base for pay. Occult Skull was sent to processing and loose ends were tied up.
