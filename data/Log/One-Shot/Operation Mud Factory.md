news: Halide | Operation Mud Factory debrief

I know this is technically under Carbide's purview, but he's taking too long for my liking. I grabbed some lackeys that weren't doing anything important and shipped them over to Lady Grave's new factory. Frankly, given the money machine she had going there, she should have locked that place down with triple the security.

Regardless, the mission team infiltrated the factory from the roof. They lured@footnote(1, Lured is the wrong word. Moreso attracted by being complete amateurs.) guards over to their hiding spot and took them out, hiding them in the closet. The team incapacitated the foreman and took his key, and cleared out some of the remaining guards that I took the care of poisoning.

The group found the package in the basement, after loudly breaking down a locked door@footnote(2, They had the key...). Cue a mad dash out of the factory and me scrambling to get them a ride out of there since I expected them to do it quietly. Luckily, they actually managed to escape. The skull's on the way to the Broker now.
