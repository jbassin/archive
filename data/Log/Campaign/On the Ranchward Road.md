Karpies in hand, the group set off southward to track down Jake Halloway and his stolen cargo. Whilst trekking through the difficult Saloren fen, the group spotted some mysterious lights in the distance. Believing the lights to mark possible treasure, they investigated, but only found a corpselight feeding ground. Moving on, our heroes found a divot in which to camp for the night.

Overnight, the party heard the sound of a group of horse riders passing quickly by their camp towards the city, but they were able to conceal their presence and stay undisturbed. Nevertheless, they pushed onward until their destination was in sight: Lone Oak Ranch. Not knowing when the riders of the previous night might return, the group began their assault on the ranchhouse posthaste. They deftly and silently grappled up to the second story of the building but were accosted by members of the bandit gang who lived there. A quick and decisive battle was fought, and the now-revealed semicorporeal and kindled lycan were defeated.
