Progressing nicely into their hunt for Jake Halloway, our famous adventurers found themselves in Alexander Sarken's home, sans-Sarken. Instead, the only thing of note was a modified oneiroscope (pocketed, in case it was relevant). A keen eye, however, found a looky-loo in an abandoned home a few doors down. The group moved their attention to their peeping tom, but they were nowhere to be found! Instead, in their place, was a note arranging a covert meeting, written in kalamic ink.

Not ones to be deterred, the heroes met with the note's author -- Carbide -- who wished to retain their services to hunt down the box they were already pursuing. While Carbide was reticent to say the contents of the box, he did offer money and the location of Alexander (under the Network's care) and so our party accepted.

Now in bed with both the good lady and the network, the group decided to spend their newly-earned money and start following their last lead: Jake Halloway and the Lone Oak Ranch. They met with the eccentric Kilwin and gained cold iron covered weapons, as well as some silver bullets. The group also took a detour and met with one Luca Merino at the Mistwatch Arcanum, who gave them the side quest of tracking down some resonance crystals for him. Finally, the party purchased a pair of karpies and a wagon and began their trek south to the Lone Oak Ranch.
