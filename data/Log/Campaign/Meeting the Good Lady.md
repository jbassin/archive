No good deed goes unrewarded in sparkling Toleros! Just moments after their daring rescue of a train in distress, our intrepid heroes receive an invitation to dine with the highest power in the city: Marquessa Calliana Anatal Grave. Not ones to come empty-handed to dinner, the group set out to properly equip themselves; Archie Helmswright (the scampy proprietor of the Hammer & Pin) acquainted them with the city's famous firearms, Piotr of Piotr's Poppies armed them with bouquets, and Elena Domez over at the Tidereader's Rest granted them a home base.

Well-prepared, our favorite adventuring group was led by Lady Grave's trusted servant Eduardo Calim to meet the mistress herself. The good lady lavished them with praise and requested their righteous work once again, this time to recover the stolen goods. The heroes unabashedly accepted the quest and set out to right that which was wrong. After some impressive sleuthing they identified the culprit -- one Jake 'Sureshot' Halloway. They also knew where to begin looking for clues -- Lady Grave's known associate and artificer Alexander Sarken. Tracking Sarken back to his home in the beautiful Fountain of Youth district, the party discovered that some hooligans were overturning his house! They quickly engaged and defeated the surprisingly hairy ruffians, and began their own investigation of the area.

The group leveled up!
