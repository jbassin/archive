On account of our musing, we didn't even hear them deepfucker bastards when they kicked Johnny, Lewis, and Roscoe. Here I am, flamed out of my fuckin mind, and these karpie-for-brains nicked my stash, Harry's taxidermy set, and Jake's entire haul from the train. Also, they took Roscoe's boots. What fuckin monster takes a dead man's boots?

And that's just the crest of this wave! Get this, they also took our damn horses! Left their karpies behind like yesterday's kelp and rode off with Queenie and Bard. Didn't even take no feed for em or nothing, too. Boss said they'd probably pass in a day, realms rest their souls. So here I am, tits up stranded out in the middle of nowhere, no ride fer miles, with three of my dead friends in my bedroom. Next time I see those swampfucks they're gonna pay, that's sure as shot.
