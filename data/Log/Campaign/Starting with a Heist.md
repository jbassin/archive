Our tale begins as all others should: with a train heist. The noble protagonists of this story met for the first time on a train headed west, to the grand cityscape of Toleros. They were deeply engaged in an insightful discussion about various wine qualities when a cadre of bandits on supernaturally fast horses overtook and boarded the train! The four heroes rushed through the train, dispatching foe after foe with ease until they reached the cargo car at the front of the locomotive. Waiting for them there was a single figure, ornate box in one hand, conductor hostage in the other. The adventurers used their brilliant charms to talk the bandit down, saving the poor conductor but letting the bandit escape with his prize instead.
